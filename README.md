# Minimum Detectable Effect Size (MDES) in a 2-level cluster randomised controlled trial

"**mdesapp**" is an online calculator that provides the Minimum Detectable Effect Size (MDES) in a 2-level Clustered Randomised Control Trial setting.
This is when whole clusters (instead of individuals) are randomised.
A typical situation is when complete classes or schools are allocated to either the intervention or the control/comparison group.

This tool was created according to the guidelines provided by the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF, 2013), which are available [**here**](https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/public/files/Evaluation/Writing_a_Protocol_or_SAP/Pre-testing_paper.pdf). [1]

The specific guideline about MDES is on page 4 and takes the formulae described in Bloom et al. (2007)[2]
