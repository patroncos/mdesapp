This calculator provides the Minimum Detectable Effect Size (MDES) according to the guidelines provided by the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF, 2013), which are available [**here**]("https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/public/files/Evaluation/Writing_a_Protocol_or_SAP/Pre-testing_paper.pdf").

This is meant to be used in a 2-level Clustered Randomised Control Trial setting.
This is when whole clusters (instead of individuals) are randomised.
A typical situation is when complete classes or schools are allocated to either the intervention or the control/comparison group.
The underlying formula assumes that the statistical power is 0.8 and the significance level is 0.05.
