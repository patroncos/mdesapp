"**mdesapp**" is an online calculator that provides the Minimum Detectable Effect Size (MDES) in a 2-level Clustered Randomised Control Trial setting.
This is when whole clusters (instead of individuals) are randomised.
A typical situation is when complete classes or schools are allocated to either the intervention or the control/comparison group.
